Welcome to my first blog post on my static website!

As an electrical engineer I have always been familiar with how the physical world reacted and to measure its response.
The concepts of Current, voltage, resistance, impedance etc. were easily grasped as these parameters ould be measured using
a Voltmeter, ammeter or any other bridge networks. Not to say that these concepts were easily grasped and it took some time
understanding a few things properly(If anyone of you has been familiar with the concept of fourier transform they will
readily agree with Me) 

However, understanding the concepts of a synchronous or an induction motor were far more easy as compared to understanding
mux(multiplexers) and demux(de-multiplexers). However, with the change in the world, I found that I need to upgrade My skills
soon in order to be competitive in this technical world.

Wireless telecommunications provided Me that step forward with 5G and Telecom world progressing rapidly(By now the Starlink
engineered by SpaceX is making ripples in the world). However, I faced some real challenges when dealing with network scripting
and Data networks. Radio Frequency technology and Applied Electromagnetics were easier to understand due to My electrical background.
However, I soon grew to understand and get better at the Networking concepts and programming.

From not being able to understand the Linux commands, confusing between files and folders to being confident enough to teach my 
juniors shell scripting I have come a long way. That does not mean I have learnt everything. Every day new technologies emerge 
and I have to keep myself aware of the changes and become better. 

I will do My best to post daily of how I gained the knowledge and try to atleast clear the basic concepts as well as I can so that
someone who is completely lost in this world can regain their footing and gain confidence in the world of tech!
