## Where shall we begin?

IT jobs fetch 6 figure Jobs! No need for learning Programming to get in IT! Catchy titles, no?
Human tendency to find a shortcut has no bounds. Even the latest trend with AI and Cybersecurity
as a jumpboard to one's career reeks of this shortcut. Truth be told one has to always lay the 
foundations of the house before even considering the roof design.

Same goes for the Technical Jobs. A basic undertsanding of how Information systems work is 
important. 

In case of IT sector I believe Networking is foundation. Just as humans need Language to communicate,
so do computers, and the Language of computers is binary -  0s and 1s. This binary language lead
to the identification system for computers and other digital devices to as early as 1970s when
the precursor to Internet, ARPANET was being developed.

Internet Protocol Addressing system that has been in use since the conception of internet, also 
known by it's abbreviation IPv4 is widely used. We talk about networking, how can we forget the
Open Systems Interconnection(OSI) model? Or should I talk about the Networking Protocols 1st?

Hmmmm...with so many options going on how to begin the Networking Journey I will be dividing it into
the following Parts

1. Networking Basics for Absolute Beginners

  - Introduce key concepts like LAN, WAN, and the Internet.
  - Explain client-server models and peer-to-peer networks.

2. Evolution of Networking Protocols

  - Explore how protocols like TCP/IP, HTTP, and FTP came into existence.
  - Explain why these protocols are essential.

3. The OSI Model Simplified

  - Break down the seven layers of the OSI model with examples.
  - Relate it to real-world networking processes.

4. Introduction to IPv4 and IPv6

  - Discuss the structure of IP addresses.
  - Explain why IPv6 is important for the future of networking.

5. Wireless Networking Fundamentals

  - Cover Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and emerging technologies like 5G.
  - Explain how wireless communication revolutionized networking.

6. Understanding Data Transmission

  - Introduce concepts like bandwidth, latency, and throughput.
  - Discuss how data moves across the network.

7. Networking Security Basics

  - Provide an introduction to firewalls, VPNs, and encryption.
  - Discuss the importance of securing networks.

8. The Role of Network Administrators

  - Highlight the responsibilities of managing and maintaining a network.
  - Give a glimpse into tools used for network monitoring and troubleshooting.

And no, I won't be making it a course. It is a Blog. A blog where I will share My personal 
experiences about how I learned about these topics. Be that while I was learning from My program
coordinator and professors, learning from My colleagues, teaching My juniors...and in the process
rediscovering that I needed to revisit the concepts Myself, or be it during the time when I got Work!
:')

Lots of Fun filled and Practical stuff will be Taught in My Blog, So stay tuned!
